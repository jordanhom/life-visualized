# System Patterns: Life Visualized

## 1. Architecture Overview

`life-visualized` is a client-side, single-page web application. It follows a modular architecture implemented in vanilla JavaScript using ES Modules.

* **Frontend Only:** All logic (calculation, rendering, UI management) runs in the user's browser. There is no backend component.
* **Modular JS:** Code is separated into distinct modules based on responsibility:
  * `main.js`: Application entry point, initializes UI.
  * `ui.js`: Controller/View-Model - Handles user interactions, manages UI state, orchestrates calls to other modules.
  * `calculator.js`: Model/Service - Performs core age and lifespan calculations.
  * `data.js`: Model/Data Source - Provides the static actuarial data.
  * `gridRenderer.js`: View/Rendering Engine - Generates the HTML for the different grid visualizations.
* **Single HTML (`index.html`):** Contains the static structure and placeholders for dynamic content.
* **Single CSS (`style.css`):** Defines all visual styles and layout rules, including responsiveness.

## 2. Key Technical Decisions & Patterns

* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules):** Chosen for simplicity and performance, avoiding framework overhead for this specific application scope. Enables clear separation of concerns via modules.
* **UTC-Based Date Handling:**
  * **Decision:** All internal date storage and calculations are performed using UTC to ensure consistency and avoid timezone/DST errors.
  * **Pattern:** Input date string is normalized to a UTC midnight Date object in `ui.js`. This normalized object is stored and passed to `gridRenderer.js`, which uses `date-fns` functions configured for UTC.
* **UI State Management (`ui.js`):**
  * **Pattern:** Simple module-level variables (`currentView`, `lastCalcData`) are used to maintain the selected view and the results of the last calculation.
  * **Rationale:** Sufficient for the current application state; avoids the complexity of a dedicated state management library. Enables efficient view switching without recalculation.
* **Rendering Strategy (`gridRenderer.js`):**
  * **Pattern:** Direct DOM manipulation using `document.createElement` and leveraging `DocumentFragment` for efficient batch appends to minimize browser reflows. Renders into a specific inner container (`#grid-content-area`) to avoid clearing other nested elements. (UPDATED)
  * **Rationale:** Performant enough for the current grid sizes; avoids introducing rendering library dependencies. The inner container approach is necessary when other UI elements are nested within the main scrollable grid container. (UPDATED)
* **CSS Layout Strategy:**
  * **Pattern:** Fixed-width main grid container (`#life-grid-container`) based on Week view requirements, combined with dynamic block sizing (`calc()` + `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1`) for Month/Year views. The Results area (`#results-area`) shares the same `max-width` as the grid for visual alignment. The Grid Controls Header (`#grid-controls-header`) and Grid Guide Details (`#grid-guide-details`) are nested *inside* `#life-grid-container` and inherit its width constraints. (UPDATED)
  * **Rationale:** Provides visual consistency across views (no layout shifts) while allowing Month/Year blocks to fill the space effectively. Responsiveness is handled via tiered media queries adjusting container `max-width` and block sizes/gaps. The nested header uses Flexbox for internal layout and becomes columnar on smaller screens, while the nested guide uses Flexbox for a 2-column layout that stacks responsively. (UPDATED)
  * The results statistics are displayed in a 2-column grid (`.results-stats-grid`) with `grid-template-columns: auto auto` and `width: fit-content`, centered within its container. Body padding and main container `max-width` have been adjusted for better large-screen layout. (NEW)
  * Responsive CSS reduces vertical padding/margins in the results area and removes body top/bottom padding on small screens to optimize vertical space. (NEW)
* **Dependency Management:**
  * **Pattern:** `date-fns` library is loaded via CDN. `gridRenderer.js` includes a check (`checkDateFns`) for its presence.
  * **Rationale:** Simple integration for a key dependency.

## 3. Component Relationships & Data Flow - Updated for Nested Structure

* **Initialization:** `main.js` calls `ui.setupEventListeners()`.
* **Calculation Flow:**
    1. User submits form (`index.html`).
    2. `ui.js` (`handleCalculation`) validates input, normalizes date to UTC.
    3. `ui.js` resets visibility of post-calculation UI elements (results, main grid container). Explicitly hides nested header/guide as they also have `.hidden` initially. (UPDATED)
    4. `ui.js` displays loading indicators (button text, results area message). (NEW)
    5. `ui.js` calls `calculator.js` (`calculateCurrentAge`, `getRemainingExpectancy`).
    6. `calculator.js` reads data from `data.js`.
    7. `calculator.js` returns results (or throws error) to `ui.js`.
    8. **On Success:**
        * `ui.js` stores results in `lastCalcData`.
        * `ui.js` hides the input form. (NEW)
        * `ui.js` updates `#results-area` via `displayResults`.
        * `ui.js` calls `renderCurrentView()` (to render the grid).
        * `ui.js` reveals Results Area and the main Grid Container (`#life-grid-container`). Explicitly reveals the nested Grid Controls Header (`#grid-controls-header`) and Grid Guide Details (`#grid-guide-details`). (UPDATED)
        * `ui.js` reveals the "Start Over" button (placed after the grid container). (NEW)
    9. **On Error:**
        * `ui.js` updates `#results-area` via `displayError`.
        * `ui.js` reveals Results Area.
        * `ui.js` calls `renderCurrentView()` (to clear grid content area). (UPDATED)
        * `ui.js` ensures the input form remains visible. (NEW)
        * Main grid container and its contents remain hidden.
* **Rendering Flow:**
    1. `ui.js` (`renderCurrentView`) determines the view type (`currentView`).
    2. `ui.js` calls the appropriate function in `gridRenderer.js` (e.g., `renderMonthsGrid`), passing `lastCalcData` and the specific `#grid-content-area` element. (UPDATED)
    3. `gridRenderer.js` function clears the *provided element's* (`#grid-content-area`) content. (UPDATED)
    4. `gridRenderer.js` performs UTC date calculations using `date-fns`.
    5. `gridRenderer.js` generates DOM elements (rows, blocks) with correct classes/attributes.
    6. `gridRenderer.js` appends elements to the *provided element* (`#grid-content-area`). (UPDATED)
    7. `gridRenderer.js` sets the `aria-label` on the *parent* (`#life-grid-container`) for overall context. (UPDATED)
* **View Switch Flow:**
    1. User clicks a button in `#view-switcher` (`index.html`).
    2. `ui.js` (`handleViewChange`) updates `currentView` state, updates button active/ARIA states.
    3. `ui.js` calls `renderCurrentView()`.
    4. Rendering flow proceeds using the *existing* `lastCalcData`, targeting `#grid-content-area`. (UPDATED)

## 4. Critical Implementation Details

* **`gridRenderer.js` - Age View Week Logic:** Uses `eachWeekOfInterval` + `filter(isBefore)` + `.pop()` (if length 54) to accurately determine the ISO weeks starting within each year of life, ensuring visual consistency (max 53 weeks/row).
* **`gridRenderer.js` - Calendar View:** Uses `getISOWeeksInYear` and correctly handles the 52/53 week variation. Applies `out-of-bounds` styling based on comparison with `firstWeekStartDateUTC` and `estimatedEndDateUTC`.
* **CSS `calc()` + `aspect-ratio`:** The core mechanism for ensuring Month/Year blocks fill the fixed container width while remaining square. Formulas must be updated in media queries if gaps change.
* **`js/ui.js` - `handleViewChange()`:** Logic handles clicks on `.view-button` elements, reads `data-view`, manages `.active` class and `aria-checked` attributes.
* **`index.html` - `#grid-content-area`:** A dedicated `div` within `#life-grid-container` that serves as the specific target for grid rendering, preventing clearing of other nested elements like the header and guide. (NEW)
* **CSS - `position: sticky`:** Applied to `#grid-controls-header` to keep it visible at the top of the scrollable `#life-grid-container`. (NEW)
* **CSS - `.view-button` Styling:** Uses `white-space: normal` to allow wrapping and `min-height` to ensure consistent vertical size for all buttons, combined with `display: inline-flex` and `align-items: center` for vertical text centering. (NEW)
* **CSS - Responsive Centering:** `align-items: center` is used on `#grid-controls-header` within the columnar media query to maintain horizontal centering of the button group. (NEW)

## 5. UI/Interaction Patterns - Updated for Refinements

* **Progressive Reveal:** Initially hide non-essential UI elements (results, main grid container) using a `.hidden` class. Reveal these elements via JavaScript (`ui.js`) upon successful calculation completion. This provides a cleaner initial view focused on the input form. The results area is always revealed on calculation attempt to show success or error messages. (UPDATED)
  * **Post-Calculation Flow:** On success, the input form is hidden. The results (including input parameters, displayed in a centered grid) are shown, followed by the grid container (with its controls and guide), and then a "Start Over" button (placed after the grid container). (NEW)
* **Integrated & Nested Controls Header:** (UPDATED) A dedicated header bar (`#grid-controls-header`) is placed directly *inside* the grid container (`#life-grid-container`). It contains the view switcher (`#view-switcher`), implemented as styled `<button>` elements (`.view-button`) acting as a segmented control (`role="radiogroup"`). The active button indicates the current view, and tooltips (`title` attribute) on each button provide view descriptions on hover/focus. This pattern tightly couples the view controls with the grid and removes the need for a separate dynamic title element. (UPDATED)
* **Sticky Controls Header:** (NEW) The nested header bar uses `position: sticky` to remain visible at the top of the `#life-grid-container` when the grid content area below it is scrolled, improving accessibility of controls for long grids.
* **Consolidated & Collapsible Guide/Key:** The grid explanation and color key are combined into a single `<details id="grid-guide-details">` element. This element is now placed *inside* the `#life-grid-container`, below the controls header and above the grid content area. It remains collapsible and uses a 2-column layout (stacking responsively) for its content. **The explanation text within has been refined for conciseness and clarity.** This places the explanation in close proximity to the visualization it describes. (UPDATED)
* **No Section Headings:** Explicit `<h2>` headings for "Results" and "Visualization" were removed as the content flow makes their purpose clear, reducing visual noise.
* **Constrained Width Alignment:** The main grid container and the results area share the same `max-width` and are centered within the main container, creating a visually cohesive block post-calculation. (UPDATED)
  * The overall page `.container` `max-width` has been reduced, and `body` padding adjusted for better large-screen aesthetics. (NEW)
* **Dynamic Button State:** The "Calculate & Visualize" button is disabled until both birth date and sex inputs are valid. (NEW)
* **Loading Indicators:** The "Calculate & Visualize" button text changes to "Calculating..." and the results area displays a loading message during processing. (NEW)
* **"Start Over" Functionality:** A dedicated button allows users to reset the application to its initial input state. (NEW)
* **Responsive Results Area:** Vertical padding and margins within the results area are reduced on smaller screens to conserve space. (NEW)
