# Progress: Life Visualized (YYYY-MM-DD)

## 1. Current Status

The project has reached its initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) state as defined in `projectbrief.md`. All core requirements for calculation, visualization (across all four views: Weeks-Age, Weeks-Calendar, Months, Years), UI interaction, and basic presentation are implemented and functional. A comprehensive documentation pass (code comments, Memory Bank initialization) has also been completed.

## 2. What Works (Completed Features)

*   **Input & Calculation:**
    *   User input for birth date and sex.
    *   Calculation of current age.
    *   Lookup of estimated remaining lifespan using `data.js` (US CDC 2021 data).
    *   Calculation of total estimated lifespan.
    *   Display of calculated results.
    *   Basic input validation and error handling.
*   **Grid Visualization:**
    *   Rendering of all four specified views:
        *   Weeks (Age-based) - Handles 52/53 week variations per age year.
        *   Weeks (Calendar-based) - Handles 52/53 ISO weeks per calendar year, includes `out-of-bounds` styling.
        *   Months (Age-based, 12 per row).
        *   Years (Age-based, 10 per row - decades).
    *   Accurate color-coding of blocks based on defined life stages.
    *   Clear visual distinction between past, present, and future blocks.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Functional form for input.
    *   Clear display area for results/errors (`aria-live` enabled).
    *   Working view toggle radio buttons allowing seamless switching between grid types.
    *   Fixed-width grid container preventing layout shifts during view changes.
    *   Dynamic block sizing for Month/Year views to fill container width.
    *   Expandable explanation section for visualization details.
    *   Color key legend.
    *   Disclaimer text.
*   **Technical Foundation:**
    *   Modular vanilla JS structure.
    *   Robust UTC-based date handling using `date-fns`.
    *   Responsive design implemented across multiple breakpoints.
    *   Cleaned and documented codebase (JS, HTML, CSS).
    *   Initialized Cline Memory Bank files (`projectbrief`, `productContext`, `systemPatterns`, `techContext`, `activeContext`, `progress`).

## 3. What's Left to Build (Potential Future Work)

These items are currently considered **Out of Scope** for the MVP but represent potential future enhancements:

*   Adding user-defined milestones or events to the grid.
*   Allowing selection of different actuarial datasets (e.g., different countries, years, cohort vs. period tables).
*   User accounts or local storage persistence to save user data/preferences.
*   More advanced UI customization options (e.g., color themes).
*   More sophisticated error handling or user guidance.
*   Automated testing suite (unit, integration, e2e).
*   Performance optimization if grid sizes become significantly larger (though current approach with `DocumentFragment` is reasonably efficient).

## 4. Known Issues

*   **None currently identified.** The application appears stable and functional according to the MVP requirements. (Future testing might uncover issues).

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Layout:** Shifted from potentially variable grid container width to a fixed width (based on Week view) for UI stability, necessitating dynamic block sizing (`calc()` + `aspect-ratio`) for Month/Year views.
*   **Week Calculation (Age View):** Refined the logic using `date-fns` (`eachWeekOfInterval` + `filter` + `pop`) to accurately handle edge cases around year boundaries and 54-week overlaps.
*   **Documentation:** Moved from potentially large header comments to concise headers + detailed inline comments for better maintainability.
*   **Accessibility:** Added `aria-live` and row `aria-label` attributes during refinement phase.
