# Progress Log - Life Visualized

## MVP - Functionally Complete / UX Refinements Pending

**Status:** All core features defined in `projectbrief.md` are implemented and functional. A comprehensive UX review (using Dr. Reed persona based on `prompt-ux-review.md`) has been completed, identifying critical refinements needed before launch. Development is currently **paused**.

**Completed Tasks (MVP Build & Initial Refinements):**

*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   User input form (DOB, Sex).
    *   Calculation logic based on actuarial data (US CDC 2021).
    *   Display of calculated results (age, remaining years, total estimate).
    *   Grid rendering logic.
*   **Visualizations:**
    *   Weeks-Age View implemented.
    *   Weeks-Calendar View implemented.
    *   Months View implemented.
    *   Years View implemented.
*   **Layout & Styling:**
    *   Basic HTML structure and CSS styling.
    *   Fixed-width grid container with dynamic block sizing (`calc()`, `aspect-ratio`) for Month/Year views.
    *   Responsive design tiers implemented via media queries.
*   **Documentation & Refinement:**
    *   Initial JSDoc comments added to JS modules.
    *   HTML semantic improvements.
    *   CSS rule consolidation and cleanup.
    *   Accessibility improvements (labels, fieldsets, aria-live, roles).
    *   **Visual Cleanup & CSS Refactoring:** Introduced CSS variables, standardized spacing, improved button styling, reorganized CSS.
    *   **Progressive Reveal & Layout Refinement:** Implemented progressive reveal flow. Refined post-calculation layout (aligned widths, removed headings).
    *   **Consolidated Grid Guide/Key:** Combined Explanation and Color Key into a single `<details>` element with 2-column layout.
    *   **Integrated Controls Header Refinement:** Moved controls/guide inside grid container, added `#grid-content-area`, implemented sticky header, added tooltips, refined button styles.
    *   **Refined Grid Explanation Text:** Iteratively refined the "Understanding the Grid" text within the guide details for clarity and user-friendliness, particularly clarifying the Weeks (Calendar) view. *(Last code change before pause)*.
*   **Memory Bank:**
    *   Initialized core memory bank files.
    *   Maintained updates throughout MVP development, including major refactors and feature additions.
    *   Updated to reflect UX review outcome and pause status.
*   **Supporting Files:**
    *   Added prompt files (`prompt-*.md`) used for UX review and privacy instructions to the repository.

**Next Steps (Upon Resuming Development):**

Implement the **critical UX refinements** identified in the review before considering the MVP ready for launch/testing:
1.  **Feedback & Input Handling:** Implement loading states during calculation and input validation logic (disable button until valid).
2.  **Core Clarity - Guide Visual Aid:** Add the recommended visual aid (diagram/image) to the guide to further clarify View B's alignment.
3.  **Accessibility Foundations:** Implement keyboard navigation for the view switcher (`tablist` pattern), verify/fix critical color contrast issues, and ensure visible focus indicators.
4.  **Tone & Framing:** Review UI text for neutral language and ensure the disclaimer/reassurance message is prominent and clear.

**Out of Scope (Post-MVP):**

*   Fetching real-time or alternative actuarial datasets.
*   More sophisticated life stage calculations/coloring.
*   Saving/loading user data or preferences.
*   Advanced UI features (tooltips on blocks, zooming, etc.).
*   Internationalization (i18n).
*   Build process/bundling.
