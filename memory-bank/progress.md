# Progress Log - Life Visualized

## MVP - Complete (Functionally) / Pending Final Review

**Status:** All core features defined in `projectbrief.md` are implemented and functional. Visual cleanup/refactoring and progressive reveal implementation are complete. The application now presents a clean initial interface and reveals results/visualizations upon successful calculation. The next step is final review and testing before declaring the MVP officially complete.

**Completed Tasks:**

*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   User input form (DOB, Sex).
    *   Calculation logic based on actuarial data (US CDC 2021).
    *   Display of calculated results (age, remaining years, total estimate).
    *   Grid rendering logic.
*   **Visualizations:**
    *   Weeks-Age View implemented.
    *   Weeks-Calendar View implemented.
    *   Months View implemented.
    *   Years View implemented.
*   **Layout & Styling:**
    *   Basic HTML structure and CSS styling.
    *   Fixed-width grid container with dynamic block sizing (`calc()`, `aspect-ratio`) for Month/Year views.
    *   Responsive design tiers implemented via media queries.
*   **Documentation & Refinement:**
    *   Initial JSDoc comments added to JS modules.
    *   HTML semantic improvements.
    *   CSS rule consolidation and cleanup.
    *   Accessibility improvements (labels, fieldsets, aria-live).
    *   **Visual Cleanup & CSS Refactoring:**
        *   Introduced CSS variables (`:root`) for spacing, typography, borders, and key colors. Replaced hardcoded values.
        *   Standardized vertical spacing between major sections using `margin-bottom`.
        *   Made calculate button full-width on mobile.
        *   Reorganized CSS file structure for better readability.
        *   Added file structure overview comment and improved comment consistency.
        *   Converted specific `h1`, grid background, and key swatch border colors to variables.
    *   **Progressive Reveal Implementation:** (NEW)
        *   Added intro text below heading.
        *   Added `.hidden` utility class to CSS.
        *   Applied `hidden` class initially to results, view toggle, explanation, color key, and grid container in HTML.
        *   Updated `ui.js` (`handleCalculation`) to manage element visibility based on calculation success/failure.
        *   Refactored Color Key into a collapsible `<details>` element for consistency and placed it before the grid.
        *   Updated comments across HTML, CSS, JS to reflect changes.
*   **Memory Bank:**
    *   Initialized core memory bank files.
    *   Updated memory bank after MVP feature completion.
    *   Updated memory bank after visual cleanup.
    *   Updated memory bank after progressive reveal implementation. (NEW)

**Next Steps:**

*   Perform final review and testing of all features and the progressive reveal flow across different views and screen sizes. (NEW)
*   Declare MVP officially complete.

**Out of Scope (Post-MVP):**

*   Fetching real actuarial data.
*   More sophisticated life stage calculations/coloring.
*   Saving/loading user data.
*   Advanced UI features (tooltips on blocks, zooming, etc.).
*   Internationalization (i18n).
*   Build process/bundling.
