# Progress Log - Life Visualized

## MVP - UX Refinements In Progress

**Status:** All core features defined in `projectbrief.md` are implemented and functional. A comprehensive UX review (using Dr. Reed persona based on `prompt-ux-review.md`) has been completed. Development is now **active**, focusing on implementing the identified critical UX refinements detailed in `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/prompts/by-project/life-visualized/prompt-ux-review-implementation-instructions.md`.

**Completed Tasks (MVP Build & Initial Refinements):**

* **Core Functionality:**
  * User input form (DOB, Sex).
  * Calculation logic based on actuarial data (US CDC 2021).
  * Display of calculated results (age, remaining years, total estimate).
  * Grid rendering logic.
* **Visualizations:**
  * Weeks-Age View implemented.
  * Weeks-Calendar View implemented.
  * Months View implemented.
  * Years View implemented.
* **Layout & Styling:**
  * Basic HTML structure and CSS styling.
  * Fixed-width grid container with dynamic block sizing (`calc()`, `aspect-ratio`) for Month/Year views.
  * Responsive design tiers implemented via media queries.
* **Documentation & Refinement:**
  * Initial JSDoc comments added to JS modules.
  * HTML semantic improvements.
  * CSS rule consolidation and cleanup.
  * Accessibility improvements (labels, fieldsets, aria-live, roles).
  * **Visual Cleanup & CSS Refactoring:** Introduced CSS variables, standardized spacing, improved button styling, reorganized CSS.
  * **Progressive Reveal & Layout Refinement:** Implemented progressive reveal flow. Refined post-calculation layout (aligned widths, removed headings).
  * **Consolidated Grid Guide/Key:** Combined Explanation and Color Key into a single `<details>` element with 2-column layout.
  * **Integrated Controls Header Refinement:** Moved controls/guide inside grid container, added `#grid-content-area`, implemented sticky header, added tooltips, refined button styles.
  * **Refined Grid Explanation Text:** Iteratively refined the "Understanding the Grid" text within the guide details for clarity and user-friendliness, particularly clarifying the Weeks (Calendar) view. *(Last code change before pause)*.
* **Memory Bank:**
  * Initialized core memory bank files.
  * Maintained updates throughout MVP development, including major refactors and feature additions.
  * Updated to reflect UX review outcome and pause status.
* **Supporting Files:**
  * Added prompt files (`prompt-*.md`) used for UX review and privacy instructions to the repository.

**Current Focus (Implementing UX Refinements):**

The following key areas of refinement, detailed in `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/prompts/by-project/life-visualized/prompt-ux-review-implementation-instructions.md`, are being addressed:

1. Initial State & Engagement (Completed)
2. Input Simplicity & Friction Reduction (Completed - HTML, CSS, JS logic for dynamic button state)
3. Calculation Feedback & Loading State (Completed - Button text/state, Results area message)
4. Progressive Reveal Hierarchy & Interaction (Completed - Form hiding, "Start Over" button implementation and placement, refined results display (grid layout, centered, responsive spacing), body/container padding adjustments for large and small screens)
5. Sticky Header & View Switching Usability (Tablist Pattern) (Completed - Implemented ARIA `tablist` for view switcher buttons, enhancing keyboard navigation and accessibility. Sticky header part was already in place.)
6. Grid Visualization & Block State Clarity (Accessible Patterns) (Completed MVP - Made grid container (`#grid-content-area`) focusable with descriptive `aria-label` and `aria-roledescription` for screen reader overview.)
7. Color Coding & Accessibility (Contrast, Color Blindness Support) (Deferred for MVP)
8. View B Alignment Clarity (Guide Update & Axis Labels) (COMPLETED)
    * Implemented axis labels (top and left) for the grid.
    * Confirmed textual explanation for "Weeks (Calendar)" view, with axis labels, provides sufficient clarity. Visual diagram deferred.
9. Guide Discoverability & Text Refinements (COMPLETED)
    * Confirmed accuracy of "current block is highlighted" statement in guide; removed related TODO.
    * Refactored inline styles for guide paragraph margins to `style.css`.
10. Layout & Responsiveness (COMPLETED)
    * Resolved horizontal scrolling issues for Week views across various screen sizes.
    * Ensured Month and Year views align visually with Week views.
    * Aligned "Start Over" button width with other page containers.
    * Consolidated button styling.
11. General Accessibility Audit (Keyboard, Focus, ARIA, Zoom) (Largely Completed)
    * Improved keyboard navigation flow by setting initial focus post-calculation.
    * Implemented unified and clear `:focus-visible` styles for interactive elements.
    * Enhanced focus visibility for the view switcher tablist by styling the container on `focusin`.
    * Reviewed ARIA implementation; confirmed dynamic `aria-label` for grid content is appropriate.
    * (Decision: Zoom usability testing deferred for MVP).
    * (Decision: Safari Tabbing Issue accepted for MVP).
12. Emotional Tone & Sensitivity

**Known Issues/Errata:**

* **Safari Tabbing Behavior:**
  * Tabbing to the "Calculate & Visualize" button immediately after it becomes enabled does not consistently work in Safari (focus skips the button). Works as expected in Chrome.
    * Tabbing to the "Start Over" button immediately after it becomes visible (post-calculation) does not consistently work in Safari (focus skips the button). Works as expected in Chrome.
    * (These are noted as lower priority for MVP if they require Safari-specific workarounds.)

**Out of Scope (Post-MVP):**

* Fetching real-time or alternative actuarial datasets.
* More sophisticated life stage calculations/coloring.
* Saving/loading user data or preferences.
* Advanced UI features (tooltips on blocks, zooming, etc.).
* Internationalization (i18n).
* Build process/bundling.
