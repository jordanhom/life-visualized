# Progress Log - Life Visualized

## MVP - Complete (Functionally) / Pending Final Review

**Status:** All core features defined in `projectbrief.md` are implemented and functional. Visual cleanup/refactoring, progressive reveal, and layout refinements are complete. The application now presents a clean initial interface, reveals results/visualizations logically upon successful calculation, and maintains visual consistency. The next step is final review and testing before declaring the MVP officially complete. (UPDATED)

**Completed Tasks:**

*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   User input form (DOB, Sex).
    *   Calculation logic based on actuarial data (US CDC 2021).
    *   Display of calculated results (age, remaining years, total estimate).
    *   Grid rendering logic.
*   **Visualizations:**
    *   Weeks-Age View implemented.
    *   Weeks-Calendar View implemented.
    *   Months View implemented.
    *   Years View implemented.
*   **Layout & Styling:**
    *   Basic HTML structure and CSS styling.
    *   Fixed-width grid container with dynamic block sizing (`calc()`, `aspect-ratio`) for Month/Year views.
    *   Responsive design tiers implemented via media queries.
*   **Documentation & Refinement:**
    *   Initial JSDoc comments added to JS modules.
    *   HTML semantic improvements.
    *   CSS rule consolidation and cleanup.
    *   Accessibility improvements (labels, fieldsets, aria-live, roles).
    *   **Visual Cleanup & CSS Refactoring:**
        *   Introduced CSS variables (`:root`) for spacing, typography, borders, and key colors. Replaced hardcoded values.
        *   Standardized vertical spacing between major sections using `margin-bottom`.
        *   Made calculate button full-width on mobile.
        *   Reorganized CSS file structure for better readability.
        *   Added file structure overview comment and improved comment consistency.
        *   Converted specific `h1`, grid background, and key swatch border colors to variables.
    *   **Progressive Reveal & Layout Refinement:**
        *   Added intro text below heading.
        *   Added `.hidden` utility class to CSS.
        *   Applied `hidden` class initially to results and the main grid container in HTML. (UPDATED)
        *   Updated `ui.js` (`handleCalculation`) to manage element visibility based on calculation success/failure, including explicit reveal of nested elements. (UPDATED)
        *   Removed explicit "Results" and "Visualization" `<h2>` headings.
        *   Constrained width of Results area to match grid width via CSS. (UPDATED)
        *   **Consolidated Grid Guide/Key:** Replaced separate Explanation and Color Key `<details>` with a single `<details id="grid-guide-details">`.
            *   Set `<summary>` to "How to Read This Visualization".
            *   Implemented internal 2-column layout (Flexbox) with responsive stacking.
            *   Added internal `<h3>` headings ("Understanding the Grid", "What the Colors Mean") styled with smaller font size (`--font-size-sm`).
            *   Removed explicit `gap` from vertical color key list, relying on default margins.
        *   **Integrated Controls Header Refinement:** (UPDATED)
            *   Moved the Grid Controls Header (`#grid-controls-header`) and the consolidated Grid Guide Details (`#grid-guide-details`) **inside** the main Grid Container (`#life-grid-container`). (UPDATED)
            *   Added a dedicated inner container (`#grid-content-area`) inside `#life-grid-container` for grid blocks. (NEW)
            *   Refactored `ui.js` and `gridRenderer.js` to clear and render into `#grid-content-area`. (NEW)
            *   Removed the dynamic view title (`#grid-view-title`). (UPDATED)
            *   Added tooltips (`title` attribute) to view switcher buttons. (NEW)
            *   Styled `#grid-controls-header` as sticky within `#life-grid-container`. (NEW)
            *   Styled `.view-button` for wrapping text and consistent `min-height`. (NEW)
            *   Ensured centered alignment of the view switcher on smaller screens. (NEW)
        *   Completed code review and applied minor changes (comment updates, CSS redundancy). (NEW)
*   **Memory Bank:**
    *   Initialized core memory bank files.
    *   Updated memory bank after MVP feature completion.
    *   Updated memory bank after visual cleanup.
    *   Updated memory bank after progressive reveal implementation.
    *   Updated memory bank after initial layout refinements and comment review.
    *   Updated memory bank after final layout consolidation and refinement.
    *   Updated memory bank after implementing integrated controls header.
    *   Updated memory bank after implementing nested controls/guide, rendering fix, sticky header, and button styling refinements. (NEW)

**Next Steps:**

*   Perform final review and testing of all features, including the updated UI layout, sticky header, view switching, and progressive reveal flow, across different inputs and screen sizes. (UPDATED)
*   Declare MVP officially complete.

**Out of Scope (Post-MVP):**

*   Fetching real actuarial data.
*   More sophisticated life stage calculations/coloring.
*   Saving/loading user data.
*   Advanced UI features (tooltips on blocks, zooming, etc.).
*   Internationalization (i18n).
*   Build process/bundling.
