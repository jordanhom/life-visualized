# Active Context - Life Visualized

**Current Goal:** Post-MVP Monitoring & Planning
**Current Task:** MVP Launched. Monitoring initial feedback and planning for next iteration.

**Recent Changes:**

* **MVP Launched.** (Reflected in `progress.md` task #16)
* Completed **Pre-Launch Bug Fixes & Refinements** (tab focus, focus highlight behavior, page padding, CSS cleanup). (Details in `progress.md` task #15)
* Successfully implemented all **Critical UX Refinements** (tasks 1-14) leading up to the MVP. (Details in `progress.md`)
*   Updated memory bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect current post-MVP status.
*   Consolidated "Recent Changes" and "Learnings & Insights" sections in `activeContext.md` for improved readability; `progress.md` retains detailed history.

**Next Action:** Monitor MVP performance, gather user feedback, and plan for v1.1.

**Decisions:** Zoom usability testing deferred for MVP.

* Safari Tabbing Issue: Current behavior (buttons not always focusable via tab in Safari immediately after becoming visible/enabled) is acceptable for MVP, as core functionality remains accessible. (UX Refinement #11 - Accessibility)
* Decided not to align internal text of "How to Read This Visualization" guide with outer content blocks, as its parent container's alignment is sufficient. (UX Refinement #12 - Layout)

**Blockers:** None.

* `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/index.html` (Updated for intro block, helper text, button state)
* `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/css/style.css` (Updated styles for intro block, helper text, button disabled state)
* `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/js/ui.js` (Updated for dynamic button state, axis label management, tablist keyboard nav, Start Over button container)

* `activeContext.md` (This file)

**Open Questions/Decisions:**

* Consider a broader "UI/UX consistency review" after the current critical UX refinements are implemented to ensure overall polish and cohesion. (NEW)
* User decision: Defer extensive accessibility changes post-MVP, focus on easy-to-implement/high-impact items for now. (NEW)
* **Safari Tabbing Issue:** Noted that in Safari, tabbing to the "Calculate & Visualize" button after it becomes enabled, and tabbing to the "Start Over" button after it becomes visible, does not work as expected (focus skips them). Works correctly in Chrome. Documented for potential future investigation if it becomes a higher priority. (NEW)
* **Visual Diagram for Calendar View Guide:** Decision made to defer adding a visual diagram for now. Focus is on textual clarity and the effectiveness of the new axis labels. (NEW)

**Learnings & Insights:**

* **Content & Textual Clarity:** Iterative refinement of all user-facing text (intro, helper text, disclaimers, labels, guides) for conciseness, user understanding, and appropriate tone is crucial. Precise labeling, clear input placeholders, and subtle visual cues (icons, typography, whitespace) significantly enhance usability, transparency, and engagement.

* **Layout, Styling & Visual Consistency:**
  * Strategic use of wrapper containers for related content allows precise control over layout and spacing.
  * Techniques like `width: fit-content` with `margin: auto` effectively center intrinsically sized elements.
  * Standardizing `max-width` across content sections and adjusting body/container padding are key for visual harmony. On smaller screens, unifying `max-width` for key blocks improves column appearance.
  * Presenting summary statistics in a grid format enhances readability.
  * Centralizing component styles in CSS (vs. inline) improves maintainability.

* **Responsive Design & View-Specific Adjustments:**
  * Achieving consistent alignment across different views and responsive breakpoints requires careful calculation of container `max-widths` and element dimensions.
  * `position: sticky` is effective for keeping controls visible within scrollable containers.
  * Consistent height for wrapping flex items often requires `min-height` and flex alignment properties.

* **Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation:**
  * Implementing ARIA patterns (e.g., `tablist`) and programmatic focus management significantly improves keyboard navigation and accessibility.
  * Applying clear focus styles, potentially to parent containers when a child is focused, enhances focus visibility.
  * For standard ARIA roles, dynamic `aria-label`s are often more effective than `aria-roledescription`.

* **Development Process & Code Quality:**
  * A dedicated inner container for dynamic content is essential when static elements are nested within the same parent to prevent accidental removal on `innerHTML` updates.
  * Regular review, cleanup, and thoughtful retention of historical code comments contribute to long-term maintainability.
  * Clear axis labels can significantly improve understanding of grid-based data, potentially reducing reliance on complex guide diagrams.
  * Hiding input forms post-calculation and providing a "Start Over" button streamlines UX.
