# Active Context - Life Visualized

**Current Goal:** Implement Critical UX Refinements for MVP
**Current Task:** UX Refinements - Proceeding with "10. Layout & Responsiveness" and "11. General Accessibility Audit".

**Recent Changes:**

* Implemented "1. Initial State & Engagement" UX refinements in `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/index.html` (icon, refined intro text "Alternative D", updated labels, input placeholders).
* Visually refined intro text in `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/index.html` and `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/css/style.css` by:
  * Separating the disclaimer into its own paragraph.
  * Adjusting typography (font size, color, italics) for intro text and disclaimer for better hierarchy and unobtrusiveness.
  * Wrapping the intro text and disclaimer in an `.intro-block-container` div.
  * Applying balanced vertical margins, horizontal padding, and center-alignment to `.intro-block-container` for improved visual flow and spacing.
  * Tightened spacing between intro text and disclaimer.
* Implemented HTML for helper text (label supplements) and initial button state (disabled, title) for Task 2 ("Input Simplicity & Friction Reduction") in `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/index.html`. (NEW)
* Implemented JavaScript logic for dynamic button state (enabled/disabled based on input validity) in `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/js/ui.js` for Task 2.
* Implemented loading state indicators for the "Calculate & Visualize" button and results area in `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/js/ui.js` and `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/css/style.css` for Task 3. (COMPLETED)
* Implemented form hiding post-calculation, added "Start Over" button, and updated results display in `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/index.html`, `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/js/ui.js`, and `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/css/style.css` for Task 4. (COMPLETED)
* Refined results section copy and layout (grid for stats using `fit-content` and `auto auto` columns, centered) and "Start Over" button placement (after grid) for Task 4. (COMPLETED)
* Adjusted body padding (reduced on large screens, removed on small) and container max-width for better large-screen layout and mobile vertical space. (COMPLETED)
* Implemented responsive CSS to reduce vertical spacing in the results area on smaller screens. (COMPLETED)
* Refined intro, disclaimer, and helper text content for clarity and conciseness with Dr. Reed. (NEW)
* Development resumed to implement critical UX refinements. (Context updated)
* The project was previously paused after refining the grid explanation text and completing initial MVP features. (Context)
* Implemented ARIA `tablist` pattern for the view switcher buttons (`#view-switcher`) in `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/index.html` and `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/js/ui.js` for UX Refinement #5. This includes `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `tabindex` management, and keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Home, End). (COMPLETED)
* Enhanced accessibility of the grid visualization by making `#grid-content-area` focusable (`tabindex='0'`) and adding descriptive `aria-label` and `aria-roledescription` attributes in `js/ui.js` and `js/gridRenderer.js`. This provides a better overview for screen reader users. (UX Refinement #6 - MVP Completed)
* UX Refinement #7 ("Color Coding & Accessibility") deferred for MVP. (Decision)
* Implemented axis labels (top and left) for the grid in `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/index.html`, `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/css/style.css`, and `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/js/ui.js`. (NEW - Part of UX Refinement #8)
* Reviewed and updated code comments in `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/index.html`, `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/css/style.css`, and `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/js/ui.js` for accuracy and clarity, removing orphaned comments. Confirmed rationale for retaining specific historical comments in HTML for structural context. (NEW)
* Confirmed textual explanation for "Weeks (Calendar)" view, in conjunction with axis labels, provides sufficient clarity. (UX Refinement #8 - COMPLETED)
* Refactored inline styles for guide paragraph margins from `index.html` to `css/style.css`. (Part of UX Refinement #9)
* Confirmed accuracy of "current block is highlighted" statement in guide and removed related TODO comment from `index.html`. (UX Refinement #9 - COMPLETED)

**Next Action:** Conduct a final check on "10. Layout & Responsiveness" and then proceed to "11. General Accessibility Audit".

**Blockers:** None.

**Relevant Files Recently Modified:**

* `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/index.html` (Updated for intro block, helper text, button state)
* `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/css/style.css` (Updated styles for intro block, helper text, button disabled state)
* `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/js/ui.js` (Updated for dynamic button state, axis label management, tablist keyboard nav)
* `/Users/jhom/src/vibecode/life-visualized/js/ui.js` (Updated for dynamic button state)
* `activeContext.md` (This file)

**Open Questions/Decisions:**

* Consider a broader "UI/UX consistency review" after the current critical UX refinements are implemented to ensure overall polish and cohesion. (NEW)
* User decision: Defer extensive accessibility changes post-MVP, focus on easy-to-implement/high-impact items for now. (NEW)
* **Safari Tabbing Issue:** Noted that in Safari, tabbing to the "Calculate & Visualize" button after it becomes enabled, and tabbing to the "Start Over" button after it becomes visible, does not work as expected (focus skips them). Works correctly in Chrome. Documented for potential future investigation if it becomes a higher priority. (NEW)
* **Visual Diagram for Calendar View Guide:** Decision made to defer adding a visual diagram for now. Focus is on textual clarity and the effectiveness of the new axis labels. (NEW)

**Learnings & Insights:**

* Iterative refinement of helper text, focusing on conciseness and user understanding, is crucial for form usability. (NEW)
* Wrapping related content blocks (like an intro paragraph and its disclaimer) in a dedicated container allows for more precise control over their collective layout, spacing (margins, padding), and visual consistency. (NEW)
* Subtle typographic adjustments (font size, color) and careful management of whitespace are key to making introductory text readable yet unobtrusive. (NEW)
* Separating distinct content blocks into their own HTML elements allows for more precise and flexible CSS styling.
* Using `width: fit-content` with `margin: auto` on a grid or block element is effective for centering content that has an intrinsic width, preventing unwanted wrapping or excessive whitespace. (NEW)
* Adjusting body padding and container max-width significantly impacts perceived spaciousness and focus on larger screens. (NEW)
* Hiding the input form post-calculation and providing a "Start Over" button streamlines the UX.
* Presenting summary statistics in a grid format enhances readability.
* Collaborative refinement of introductory text can significantly improve user engagement and clarity.
* Using precise labels like "Biological Sex (for statistical estimate)" enhances transparency about data usage.
* Adding subtle visual cues (like an icon) and clearer initial text can improve first impressions and user understanding.
* Input placeholders guide users effectively.
* Commencing implementation of UX refinements marks a new phase of active development.
* Clearing `innerHTML` of a parent container will remove all its children, including elements you might intend to keep visible. A dedicated inner container for dynamic content is necessary when other static/semi-static elements are nested within the same parent.
* Using `position: sticky` is effective for keeping controls visible within a scrollable container.
* Achieving consistent height for wrapping flex items requires setting a `min-height` and potentially using flex properties (`align-items: center`) on the items themselves for vertical alignment.
* Maintaining centering across responsive breakpoints requires checking `justify-content` (for `flex-direction: row`) and `align-items` (for `flex-direction: column`) on the flex container.
* Iterative refinement of explanatory text, focusing on user questions and conciseness, can significantly improve clarity without losing essential information.
* Implementing the ARIA `tablist` pattern significantly improves keyboard navigation and accessibility for tab-like interfaces. (NEW)
* Axis labels, when implemented clearly, can significantly aid in understanding grid-based visualizations, potentially reducing the need for complex diagrams in accompanying guides. (NEW)
* Retaining specific historical comments in HTML that explain major structural changes can be valuable for long-term context, even if similar orphaned comments are removed from CSS/JS for conciseness. (NEW)
* Confirming textual explanations and removing outdated TODOs ensures documentation accuracy. (NEW)
