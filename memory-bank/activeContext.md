# Active Context: Life Visualized (YYYY-MM-DD)

## 1. Current Work Focus

The immediate focus of the most recent work session was to:
1.  Implement "Month" and "Year" grid visualization views.
2.  Ensure layout consistency across all views (Weeks, Months, Years) by establishing a fixed-width grid container.
3.  Refine the styling of Month/Year blocks to effectively fill the container width while remaining square.
4.  Perform a comprehensive documentation pass across the entire codebase (JS, HTML, CSS).
5.  Apply minor code/CSS cleanup and accessibility improvements identified during review.

This work has just been completed.

## 2. Recent Changes (Summary of Last Session)

*   **Features Added:**
    *   Month View (`renderMonthsGrid`, UI integration).
    *   Year View (`renderYearsGrid`, UI integration).
*   **Layout Refinements:**
    *   Implemented fixed `max-width` on `#life-grid-container` based on Week view needs.
    *   Implemented dynamic block sizing for Month/Year views using CSS `calc()` for `width` and `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1` for squareness.
    *   Added `max-width` and centering to the main `.container` for better large-screen layout.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Added/updated file-level headers and inline comments in all JS modules.
    *   Added comments to `index.html` and `style.css`.
*   **Code/CSS Cleanup:**
    *   Removed unused JS variables and debug code (`gridRenderer.js`).
    *   Consolidated CSS rules for life stages and block states.
    *   Removed duplicate HTML element (`#results-area`).
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   Added `aria-label` to grid rows (`gridRenderer.js`).
    *   Added `aria-live="polite"` to results area (`index.html`).

## 3. Next Steps

*   The core visualization features (Weeks/Months/Years views) and initial documentation pass are complete.
*   The project is currently at a stable point, reflecting the "MVP" state described in `projectbrief.md`.
*   **Immediate Next Step:** Draft the final core Memory Bank file, `progress.md`, to summarize the overall project status.
*   **Potential Future Steps (Post-Initialization):** Consider addressing items previously marked "Out of Scope" (e.g., custom milestones), further UI/UX refinements, or adding more comprehensive testing, depending on project direction.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations (From Last Session)

*   **Fixed Grid Width:** Confirmed as the desired approach for UI consistency.
*   **Dynamic Block Sizing:** `calc()` + `aspect-ratio` chosen over `justify-content: space-between` for better visual weight in Month/Year views.
*   **No Calendar Month/Year Views:** Reaffirmed decision to keep views focused (Age-based for Months/Years).
*   **Documentation Style:** Adopted approach of concise file headers + detailed inline comments.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

*   Maintain strict UTC handling for all date calculations and storage.
*   Continue using vanilla JS and ES Modules.
*   Prioritize clear, well-commented code.
*   Ensure responsive design remains functional across view types and breakpoints.
*   Consolidate CSS where possible (DRY principle).

## 6. Learnings & Insights

*   The `calc()` + `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1` CSS technique is effective for creating dynamically sized square blocks within a fixed-width flex container.
*   The specific `date-fns` logic (`eachWeekOfInterval` + `filter` + `pop`) for the Age View week calculation is confirmed to handle edge cases correctly.
*   Maintaining separate state (`lastCalcData`) in `ui.js` allows efficient view switching without recalculating lifespan.
