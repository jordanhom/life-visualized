# Active Context - Life Visualized

**Current Goal:** Final MVP Review & Testing

**Current Task:** Verify implementation of progressive reveal, the **final consolidated grid guide layout**, and overall application functionality.

**Next Action:** Perform comprehensive testing across different inputs, views, and screen sizes. Document any issues found.

**Blockers:** None.

**Relevant Files Recently Modified:**

*   `index.html` (Implemented final consolidated `<details>` structure with updated internal headings) (NEW)
*   `css/style.css` (Updated styles for consolidated details, internal columns, smaller h3 size, removed color key gap, updated responsive rules) (NEW)
*   `js/ui.js` (Updated DOM references and reveal logic for final consolidated details section) (NEW)
*   `progress.md` (Logged final layout consolidation) (NEW)
*   `activeContext.md` (This file) (NEW)
*   `productContext.md` (Updated user flow, key decisions for final layout) (NEW)
*   `systemPatterns.md` (Updated UI patterns, data flow for final layout) (NEW)

**Open Questions/Decisions:**

*   Decision Made: Adopted the single `<details>` section with internal columns for explanation and key. Accepted trade-off: Expanded height still significant, but initial vertical space is reduced, and content is grouped logically. User-oriented headings used.

**Learnings & Insights:**

*   Iterative layout refinement was necessary to balance information hierarchy, discoverability, and initial vertical space ("above the fold").
*   Combining related context (explanation, key) into a single collapsible element with internal structure provides a good balance for this application.
*   User-oriented phrasing for labels and headings ("How to Read...", "Understanding the Grid", "What the Colors Mean") improves clarity.
*   Relying on default list item margins can sometimes be visually preferable to explicit small gaps.
