# Active Context - Life Visualized

**Current Goal:** Prepare for Final Review

**Current Task:** Document the completed UI refinements and rendering fix in the Memory Bank.

**Recent Changes:**
*   Implemented the "Integrated Header Bar" pattern for view controls.
*   **Moved** the Grid Controls Header (`#grid-controls-header`) and the Grid Guide Details (`#grid-guide-details`) **inside** the main Grid Container (`#life-grid-container`).
*   Added a dedicated inner container (`#grid-content-area`) inside `#life-grid-container` to hold *only* the grid blocks.
*   Refactored `js/ui.js` and `gridRenderer.js` to clear and render grid blocks into `#grid-content-area`, resolving the issue where moving elements inside the container caused them to be cleared.
*   Removed the dynamic view title (`#grid-view-title`) from the header.
*   Added descriptive tooltips (`title` attribute) to the view switcher buttons (`.view-button`).
*   Styled the `#grid-controls-header` to be sticky (`position: sticky`) at the top of the `#life-grid-container` when scrolling.
*   Styled the `.view-button` elements to allow text wrapping (`white-space: normal`) and have a consistent minimum height (`min-height`) to accommodate wrapped labels.
*   Ensured the centered alignment of the view switcher is maintained on smaller screens (`align-items: center` in responsive CSS).
*   Completed a code review and applied minor changes for comment accuracy and CSS redundancy removal.

**Next Action:** Perform final review and testing of all features, including the updated UI layout, sticky header, view switching, and progressive reveal flow, across different inputs and screen sizes.

**Blockers:** None.

**Open Questions/Decisions:**

*   None currently.

**Learnings & Insights:**

*   Clearing `innerHTML` of a parent container will remove all its children, including elements you might intend to keep visible. A dedicated inner container for dynamic content is necessary when other static/semi-static elements are nested within the same parent.
*   Using `position: sticky` is effective for keeping controls visible within a scrollable container.
*   Achieving consistent height for wrapping flex items requires setting a `min-height` and potentially using flex properties (`align-items: center`) on the items themselves for vertical alignment.
*   Maintaining centering across responsive breakpoints requires checking `justify-content` (for `flex-direction: row`) and `align-items` (for `flex-direction: column`) on the flex container.
